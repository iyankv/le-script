#  TAG: request_timeout
#	How long to wait for complete HTTP request headers after initial
#	connection establishment.
#Default:
# request_timeout 5 minutes

#  TAG: persistent_request_timeout
#	How long to wait for the next HTTP request on a persistent
#	connection after the previous request completes.
#Default:
# persistent_request_timeout 2 minutes

#  TAG: client_lifetime	time-units
#	The maximum amount of time a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
#	day, 1440 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
#	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
#	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
#	If you seem to have many client connections tying up
#	filedescriptors, we recommend first tuning the read_timeout,
#	request_timeout, persistent_request_timeout and quick_abort values.
#Default:
# client_lifetime 1 day

#  TAG: half_closed_clients
#	Some clients may shutdown the sending side of their TCP
#	connections, while leaving their receiving sides open.	Sometimes,
#	Squid can not tell the difference between a half-closed and a
#	fully-closed TCP connection.
#
#	By default, Squid will immediately close client connections when
#	read(2) returns "no more data to read."
#
#	Change this option to 'on' and Squid will keep open connections
#	until a read(2) or write(2) on the socket returns an error.
#	This may show some benefits for reverse proxies. But if not
#	it is recommended to leave OFF.
#Default:
# half_closed_clients off

#  TAG: pconn_timeout
#	Timeout for idle persistent connections to servers and other
#	proxies.
#Default:
# pconn_timeout 1 minute

#  TAG: ident_timeout
#	Maximum time to wait for IDENT lookups to complete.
#
#	If this is too high, and you enabled IDENT lookups from untrusted
#	users, you might be susceptible to denial-of-service by having
#	many ident requests going at once.
#Default:
# ident_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime	time-units
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'timeout' message.
#Default:
# shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds

# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies.  The default is "webmaster."
#Default:
# cache_mgr webmaster

#  TAG: mail_from
#	From: email-address for mail sent when the cache dies.
#	The default is to use 'appname@unique_hostname'.
#	Default appname value is "squid", can be changed into
#	src/globals.h before building squid.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mail_program
#	Email program used to send mail if the cache dies.
#	The default is "mail". The specified program must comply
#	with the standard Unix mail syntax:
#	  mail-program recipient < mailfile
#
#	Optional command line options can be specified.
#Default:
# mail_program mail

#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#	If you start Squid as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the user specified below.  The default is to change
#	to UID of proxy.
#	see also; cache_effective_group
#Default:
# cache_effective_user proxy
cache_effective_user proxy

#  TAG: cache_effective_group
#	Squid sets the GID to the effective user's default group ID
#	(taken from the password file) and supplementary group list
#	from the groups membership.
#
#	If you want Squid to run with a specific GID regardless of
#	the group memberships of the effective user then set this
#	to the group (or GID) you want Squid to run as. When set
#	all other group privileges of the effective user are ignored
#	and only this GID is effective. If Squid is not started as
#	root the user starting Squid MUST be member of the specified
#	group.
#
#	This option is not recommended by the Squid Team.
#	Our preference is for administrators to configure a secure
#	user account for squid with UID/GID matching system policies.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: httpd_suppress_version_string	on|off
#	Suppress Squid version string info in HTTP headers and HTML error pages.
#Default:
# httpd_suppress_version_string off

#  TAG: visible_hostname
#	If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#	define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#	will be used. If you have multiple caches in a cluster and
#	get errors about IP-forwarding you must set them to have individual
#	names with this setting.
#Default

visible_hostname VisheraCatalyst

#  TAG: unique_hostname
#	If you want to have multiple machines with the same
#	'visible_hostname' you must give each machine a different
#	'unique_hostname' so forwarding loops can be detected.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: hostname_aliases
#	A list of other DNS names your cache has.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: umask
#	Minimum umask which should be enforced while the proxy
#	is running, in addition to the umask set at startup.
#
#	For a traditional octal representation of umasks, start
#        your value with 0.
#Default:
# umask 027

# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache
#	announcement service.  This service is provided to help
#	cache administrators locate one another in order to join or
#	create cache hierarchies.
#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration
#	service by Squid.  By default, the announcement message is NOT
#	SENT unless you enable it with 'announce_period' below.
#
#	The announcement message includes your hostname, plus the
#	following information from this configuration file:
#
#		http_port
#		icp_port
#		cache_mgr
#
#	All current information is processed regularly and made
#	available on the Web at http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Tracker/.

#  TAG: announce_period
#	This is how frequently to send cache announcements.  The
#	default is `0' which disables sending the announcement
#	messages.
#
#	To enable announcing your cache, just set an announce period.
#
#	Example:
#		announce_period 1 day
#Default:
# announce_period 0

#  TAG: announce_host
#Default:
# announce_host tracker.ircache.net

#  TAG: announce_file
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: announce_port
#	announce_host and announce_port set the hostname and port
#	number where the registration message will be sent.
#
#	Hostname will default to 'tracker.ircache.net' and port will
#	default default to 3131.  If the 'filename' argument is given,
#	the contents of that file will be included in the announce
#	message.
#Default:
# announce_port 3131

# HTTPD-ACCELERATOR OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: httpd_accel_surrogate_id
#	Surrogates (http://www.esi.org/architecture_spec_1.0.html)
#	need an identification token to allow control targeting. Because
#	a farm of surrogates may all perform the same tasks, they may share
#	an identification token.
#Default:
# httpd_accel_surrogate_id unset-id

#  TAG: http_accel_surrogate_remote	on|off
#	Remote surrogates (such as those in a CDN) honour Surrogate-Control: no-store-remote.
#	Set this to on to have squid behave as a remote surrogate.
#Default:
# http_accel_surrogate_remote off

#  TAG: esi_parser	libxml2|expat|custom
#	ESI markup is not strictly XML compatible. The custom ESI parser
#	will give higher performance, but cannot handle non ASCII character
#	encodings.
#Default:
# esi_parser custom

# DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: delay_pools
#	This represents the number of delay pools to be used.  For example,
#	if you have one class 2 delay pool and one class 3 delays pool, you
#	have a total of 2 delay pools.
#Default:
# delay_pools 0

#  TAG: delay_class
#	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
#	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
#	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
#	and here would be:
#
#	Example:
#	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
#	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
#	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
#	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
#	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool
#
#	The delay pool classes are:
#
#		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket.
#
#		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
#				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
#				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
#				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
#				32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
#				additional limit on a per user basis. This
#				only takes effect if the username is established
#				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
#				http_access rules.
#
#		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
#				external_acl's tag= reply).
#
#
#	Each pool also requires a delay_parameters directive to configure the pool size
#	and speed limits used whenever the pool is applied to a request. Along with
#	a set of delay_access directives to determine when it is used.
#
#	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
#		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
#		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
#		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"
#
#	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
#		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_access
#	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.
#
#	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
#	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
#	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
#	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).
#
#	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
#	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:
#
#Example:
# delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
# delay_access 1 deny all
# delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
# delay_access 2 deny all
# delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_parameters
#	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
#	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
#	description of delay_class.
#
#	For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
#		delay_pools pool 1
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate
#
#	For a class 2 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 2
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate individual
#
#	For a class 3 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 3
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual
#
#	For a class 4 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 4
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user
#
#	For a class 5 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 5
#		delay_parameters pool tagrate
#
#	The option variables are:
#
#		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
#				number specified in delay_pools as used in
#				delay_class lines.
#
#		aggregate	the speed limit parameters for the aggregate bucket
#				(class 1, 2, 3).
#
#		individual	the speed limit parameters for the individual
#				buckets (class 2, 3).
#
#		network		the speed limit parameters for the network buckets
#				(class 3).
#
#		user		the speed limit parameters for the user buckets
#				(class 4).
#
#		tagrate		the speed limit parameters for the tag buckets
#				(class 5).
#
#	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
#	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
#	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
#	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.
#
#	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.
#
#
#	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
#	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64Kbit/sec
#	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:
#
#		delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 8000 KByte/sec -> 64Kbit/sec.
#
#	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".
#
#
#	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
#	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256Kbit/sec (strict limit)
#	with each 8-bit network permitted 64Kbit/sec (strict limit) and each
#	individual host permitted 4800bit/sec with a bucket maximum size of 64Kbits
#	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
#	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
#	large downloads more significantly:
#
#		delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 32000 KByte/sec -> 256Kbit/sec.
#		  8 x  8000 KByte/sec ->  64Kbit/sec.
#		  8 x   600 Byte/sec  -> 4800bit/sec.
#
#
#	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
#	be limited to 128Kbits/sec no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:
#
#		delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-100)
#	The initial bucket percentage is used to determine how much is put
#	in each bucket when squid starts, is reconfigured, or first notices
#	a host accessing it (in class 2 and class 3, individual hosts and
#	networks only have buckets associated with them once they have been
#	"seen" by squid).
#Default:
# delay_initial_bucket_level 50

# WCCPv1 AND WCCPv2 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: wccp_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# wccp_router any_addr

#  TAG: wccp2_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: wccp_version
#	This directive is only relevant if you need to set up WCCP(v1)
#	to some very old and end-of-life Cisco routers. In all other
#	setups it must be left unset or at the default setting.
#	It defines an internal version in the WCCP(v1) protocol,
#	with version 4 being the officially documented protocol.
#
#	According to some users, Cisco IOS 11.2 and earlier only
#	support WCCP version 3.  If you're using that or an earlier
#	version of IOS, you may need to change this value to 3, otherwise
#	do not specify this parameter.
#Default:
# wccp_version 4

#  TAG: wccp2_rebuild_wait
#	If this is enabled Squid will wait for the cache dir rebuild to finish
#	before sending the first wccp2 HereIAm packet
#Default:
# wccp2_rebuild_wait on

#  TAG: wccp2_forwarding_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of forwarding methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_forwarding_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_return_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of return methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache for packets that the cache
#	decides not to handle.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment.
#
#	If the "ip wccp redirect exclude in" command has been
#	enabled on the cache interface, then it is still safe for
#	the proxy server to use a l2 redirect method even if this
#	option is set to GRE.
#Default:
# wccp2_return_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_assignment_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of methods to assign the WCCP hash
#	Valid values are as follows:
#
#	hash - Hash assignment
#	mask  - Mask assignment
#
#	As a general rule, cisco routers support the hash assignment method
#	and cisco switches support the mask assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_assignment_method hash

#  TAG: wccp2_service
#	WCCP2 allows for multiple traffic services. There are two
#	types: "standard" and "dynamic". The standard type defines
#	one service id - http (id 0). The dynamic service ids can be from
#	51 to 255 inclusive.  In order to use a dynamic service id
#	one must define the type of traffic to be redirected; this is done
#	using the wccp2_service_info option.
#
#	The "standard" type does not require a wccp2_service_info option,
#	just specifying the service id will suffice.
#
#	MD5 service authentication can be enabled by adding
#	"password=<password>" to the end of this service declaration.
#
#	Examples:
#
#	wccp2_service standard 0	# for the 'web-cache' standard service
#	wccp2_service dynamic 80	# a dynamic service type which will be
#					# fleshed out with subsequent options.
#	wccp2_service standard 0 password=foo
#Default:
# wccp2_service standard 0

#  TAG: wccp2_service_info
#	Dynamic WCCPv2 services require further information to define the
#	traffic you wish to have diverted.
#
#	The format is:
#
#	wccp2_service_info <id> protocol=<protocol> flags=<flag>,<flag>..
#	    priority=<priority> ports=<port>,<port>..
#
#	The relevant WCCPv2 flags:
#	+ src_ip_hash, dst_ip_hash
#	+ source_port_hash, dst_port_hash
#	+ src_ip_alt_hash, dst_ip_alt_hash
#	+ src_port_alt_hash, dst_port_alt_hash
#	+ ports_source
#
#	The port list can be one to eight entries.
#
#	Example:
#
#	wccp2_service_info 80 protocol=tcp flags=src_ip_hash,ports_source
#	    priority=240 ports=80
#
#	Note: the service id must have been defined by a previous
#	'wccp2_service dynamic <id>' entry.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: wccp2_weight
#	Each cache server gets assigned a set of the destination
#	hash proportional to their weight.
#Default:
# wccp2_weight 10000

#  TAG: wccp_address
#Default:
# wccp_address 0.0.0.0

#  TAG: wccp2_address
#	Use this option if you require WCCP to use a specific
#	interface address.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#Default:
# wccp2_address 0.0.0.0

# PERSISTENT CONNECTION HANDLING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Also see "pconn_timeout" in the TIMEOUTS section

#  TAG: client_persistent_connections
#Default:
# client_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: server_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for clients and servers.  By
#	default, Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed)
#	with its clients and servers.  You can use these options to
#	disable persistent connections with clients and/or servers.
#Default:
# server_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: persistent_connection_after_error
#	With this directive the use of persistent connections after
#	HTTP errors can be disabled. Useful if you have clients
#	who fail to handle errors on persistent connections proper.
#Default:
# persistent_connection_after_error on

#  TAG: detect_broken_pconn
#	Some servers have been found to incorrectly signal the use
#	of HTTP/1.0 persistent connections even on replies not
#	compatible, causing significant delays. This server problem
#	has mostly been seen on redirects.
#
#	By enabling this directive Squid attempts to detect such
#	broken replies and automatically assume the reply is finished
#	after 10 seconds timeout.
#Default:
# detect_broken_pconn off

# CACHE DIGEST OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: digest_generation
#	This controls whether the server will generate a Cache Digest
#	of its contents.  By default, Cache Digest generation is
#	enabled if Squid is compiled with --enable-cache-digests defined.
#Default:
# digest_generation on

#  TAG: digest_bits_per_entry
#	This is the number of bits of the server's Cache Digest which
#	will be associated with the Digest entry for a given HTTP
#	Method and URL (public key) combination.  The default is 5.
#Default:
# digest_bits_per_entry 5

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest rebuilds.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_rewrite_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest writes to
#	disk.
#Default:
# digest_rewrite_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_swapout_chunk_size	(bytes)
#	This is the number of bytes of the Cache Digest to write to
#	disk at a time.  It defaults to 4096 bytes (4KB), the Squid
#	default swap page.
#Default:
# digest_swapout_chunk_size 4096 bytes

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage	(percent, 0-100)
#	This is the percentage of the Cache Digest to be scanned at a
#	time.  By default it is set to 10% of the Cache Digest.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage 10

# SNMP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: snmp_port
#	The port number where Squid listens for SNMP requests. To enable
#	SNMP support set this to a suitable port number. Port number
#	3401 is often used for the Squid SNMP agent. By default it's
#	set to "0" (disabled)
#
#	Example:
#		snmp_port 3401
#Default:
# snmp_port 0

#  TAG: snmp_access
#	Allowing or denying access to the SNMP port.
#
#	All access to the agent is denied by default.
#	usage:
#
#	snmp_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Example:
# snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
# snmp_access deny all
#Default:
# snmp_access deny all

#  TAG: snmp_incoming_address
#Default:
# snmp_incoming_address any_addr

#  TAG: snmp_outgoing_address
#	Just like 'udp_incoming_address', but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_incoming_address	is used for the SNMP socket receiving
#				messages from SNMP agents.
#	snmp_outgoing_address	is used for SNMP packets returned to SNMP
#				agents.
#
#	The default snmp_incoming_address is to listen on all
#	available network interfaces.
#
#	If snmp_outgoing_address is not set it will use the same socket
#	as snmp_incoming_address. Only change this if you want to have
#	SNMP replies sent using another address than where this Squid
#	listens for SNMP queries.
#
#	NOTE, snmp_incoming_address and snmp_outgoing_address can not have
#	the same value since they both use port 3401.
#Default:
# snmp_outgoing_address no_addr

# ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives ICP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  The standard UDP port for ICP is 3130.
#	Default is disabled (0).
#
#	Example:
#		icp_port 3130
#Default:
# icp_port 0

#  TAG: htcp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives HTCP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  To turn it on you want to set it to
#	4827. By default it is set to "0" (disabled).
#
#	Example:
#		htcp_port 4827
#Default:
# htcp_port 0

#  TAG: log_icp_queries	on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log. You may wish
#	do disable this if your ICP load is VERY high to speed things
#	up or to simplify log analysis.
#Default:
# log_icp_queries on

#  TAG: udp_incoming_address
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for UDP packets received from other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Only change this if you want to have all UDP queries received on
#	a specific interface/address.
#
#	NOTE: udp_incoming_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_outgoing_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# udp_incoming_address any_addr

#  TAG: udp_outgoing_address
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for UDP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Instead it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address.
#	Only change this if you want to have UDP queries sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for UDP queries from other
#	caches.
#
#	NOTE: udp_outgoing_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_incoming_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# udp_outgoing_address no_addr

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale	on|off
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control,
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#	If set to 'on', your siblings should use the option "allow-miss"
#	on their cache_peer lines for connecting to you.
#Default:
# icp_hit_stale off

#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: minimum_direct_rtt
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many rtt milliseconds away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_rtt 400

#  TAG: netdb_low
#Default:
# netdb_low 900

#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The low and high water marks for the ICMP measurement
#	database.  These are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	900 and 1000.  When the high water mark is reached, database
#	entries will be deleted until the low mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_period
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#Default:
# netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp	on|off
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has configured Squid (during compilation) with
#	'--enable-icmp' that peer will send ICMP pings to origin server
#	sites of the URLs it receives.  If you enable this option the
#	ICP replies from that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).
#	Then, when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#Default:
# query_icmp off

#  TAG: test_reachability	on|off
#	When this is 'on', ICP MISS replies will be ICP_MISS_NOFETCH
#	instead of ICP_MISS if the target host is NOT in the ICMP
#	database, or has a zero RTT.
#Default:
# test_reachability off

#  TAG: icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
#	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
#	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
#	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
#	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
#	timeout (the old default), you would write:
#
#		icp_query_timeout 2000
#Default:
# icp_query_timeout 0

#  TAG: maximum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
#	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# maximum_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: minimum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very small timeouts, even lower than
#	the normal latency variance on your link due to traffic.
#	Use this option to put an lower limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# minimum_icp_query_timeout 5

#  TAG: background_ping_rate	time-units
#	Controls how often the ICP pings are sent to siblings that
#	have background-ping set.
#Default:
# background_ping_rate 10 seconds

# MULTICAST ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: mcast_groups
#	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
#	should join to receive multicasted ICP queries.
#
#	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
#	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
#	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
#	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
#	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
#	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
#	receive replies from multicast group members.
#
#	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
#	is already in use by another group of caches.
#
#	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
#	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/).
#
#	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20
#
#	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mcast_miss_addr
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	If you enable this option, every "cache miss" URL will
#	be sent out on the specified multicast address.
#
#	Do not enable this option unless you are are absolutely
#	certain you understand what you are doing.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_addr no_addr

#  TAG: mcast_miss_ttl
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the time-to-live value for packets multicasted
#	when multicasting off cache miss URLs is enabled.  By
#	default this is set to 'site scope', i.e. 16.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_ttl 16

#  TAG: mcast_miss_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the port number to be used in conjunction with
#	'mcast_miss_addr'.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_port 3135

#  TAG: mcast_miss_encode_key
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	The URLs that are sent in the multicast miss stream are
#	encrypted.  This is the encryption key.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_encode_key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#  TAG: mcast_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	For multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
#	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
#	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
#	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
#	seconds.
#Default:
# mcast_icp_query_timeout 2000

# INTERNAL ICON OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icon_directory
#	Where the icons are stored. These are normally kept in
#	/usr/share/squid3/icons
#Default:
# icon_directory /usr/share/squid3/icons

#  TAG: global_internal_static
#	This directive controls is Squid should intercept all requests for
#	/squid-internal-static/ no matter which host the URL is requesting
#	(default on setting), or if nothing special should be done for
#	such URLs (off setting). The purpose of this directive is to make
#	icons etc work better in complex cache hierarchies where it may
#	not always be possible for all corners in the cache mesh to reach
#	the server generating a directory listing.
#Default:
# global_internal_static on

#  TAG: short_icon_urls
#	If this is enabled Squid will use short URLs for icons.
#	If disabled it will revert to the old behavior of including
#	it's own name and port in the URL.
#
#	If you run a complex cache hierarchy with a mix of Squid and
#	other proxies you may need to disable this directive.
#Default:
# short_icon_urls on

# ERROR PAGE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: error_directory
#	If you wish to create your own versions of the default
#	error files to customize them to suit your company copy
#	the error/template files to another directory and point
#	this tag at them.
#
#	WARNING: This option will disable multi-language support
#	         on error pages if used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are making translations for a
#	language that Squid does not currently provide please consider
#	contributing your translation back to the project.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#
#	The squid developers working on translations are happy to supply drop-in
#	translated error files in exchange for any new language contributions.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: error_default_language
#	Set the default language which squid will send error pages in
#	if no existing translation matches the clients language
#	preferences.
#
#	If unset (default) generic English will be used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are interested in making
#	translations for any language see the squid wiki for details.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: error_log_languages
#	Log to cache.log what languages users are attempting to
#	auto-negotiate for translations.
#
#	Successful negotiations are not logged. Only failures
#	have meaning to indicate that Squid may need an upgrade
#	of its error page translations.
#Default:
# error_log_languages on

#  TAG: err_page_stylesheet
#	CSS Stylesheet to pattern the display of Squid default error pages.
#
#	For information on CSS see http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
#Default:
# err_page_stylesheet /etc/squid3/errorpage.css

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#	To include this in your error messages, you must rewrite
#	the error template files (found in the "errors" directory).
#	Wherever you want the 'err_html_text' line to appear,
#	insert a %L tag in the error template file.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: email_err_data	on|off
#	If enabled, information about the occurred error will be
#	included in the mailto links of the ERR pages (if %W is set)
#	so that the email body contains the data.
#	Syntax is <A HREF="mailto:%w%W">%w</A>
#Default:
# email_err_data on

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage:   deny_info err_page_name acl
#	or       deny_info http://... acl
#	or       deny_info TCP_RESET acl
#
#	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  Squid remembers the last
#	acl it evaluated in http_access, and if a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.
#
#	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
#	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
#	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
#	  the first authentication related acl encountered
#	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
#	  acl processed on the last http_access line.
#
#	NP: If providing your own custom error pages with error_directory
#	    you may also specify them by your custom file name:
#	    Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys
#
#	Alternatively you can specify an error URL. The browsers will
#	get redirected (302 or 307) to the specified URL. %s in the redirection
#	URL will be replaced by the requested URL.
#
#	Alternatively you can tell Squid to reset the TCP connection
#	by specifying TCP_RESET.
#Default:
# none

# OPTIONS INFLUENCING REQUEST FORWARDING 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: nonhierarchical_direct
#	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
#	(matching hierarchy_stoplist or not cacheable request type) direct
#	to origin servers.
#
#	If you set this to off, Squid will prefer to send these
#	requests to parents.
#
#	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
#	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
#	ratio.
#
#	If you are inside an firewall see never_direct instead of
#	this directive.
#Default:
# nonhierarchical_direct on

#  TAG: prefer_direct
#	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
#	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
#	going direct fails set this to on.
#
#	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
#	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
#	fails.
#
#	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
#	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
#	acts on cacheable requests.
#Default:
# prefer_direct off

#  TAG: always_direct
#	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
#	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
#	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
#	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
#	something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	To always forward FTP requests directly, use
#
#		acl FTP proto FTP
#		always_direct allow FTP
#
#	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
#	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
#	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
#	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
#	some other rule.  Example:
#
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
#	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
#	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
#	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.
#
#	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
#	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
#	the replies see the 'cache' directive.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: never_direct
#	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
#	the description for always_direct if you have not already.
#
#	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
#	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
#	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
#	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
#		never_direct deny local-servers
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
#	servers inside the firewall use something like:
#
#		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-intranet
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# none

# ADVANCED NETWORKING OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: incoming_icp_average
#Default:
# incoming_icp_average 6

#  TAG: incoming_http_average
#Default:
# incoming_http_average 4

#  TAG: incoming_dns_average
#Default:
# incoming_dns_average 4

#  TAG: min_icp_poll_cnt
#Default:
# min_icp_poll_cnt 8

#  TAG: min_dns_poll_cnt
#Default:
# min_dns_poll_cnt 8

#  TAG: min_http_poll_cnt
#	Heavy voodoo here.  I can't even believe you are reading this.
#	Are you crazy?  Don't even think about adjusting these unless
#	you understand the algorithms in comm_select.c first!
#Default:
# min_http_poll_cnt 8

#  TAG: accept_filter
#	FreeBSD:
#
#	The name of an accept(2) filter to install on Squid's
#	listen socket(s).  This feature is perhaps specific to
#	FreeBSD and requires support in the kernel.
#
#	The 'httpready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until a full HTTP request has been received.
#	See the accf_http(9) man page for details.
#
#	The 'dataready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process.
#	See the accf_dataready(9) man page for details.
#
#	Linux:
#	
#	The 'data' filter delays delivering of new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process by TCP_ACCEPT_DEFER.
#	You may optionally specify a number of seconds to wait by
#	'data=N' where N is the number of seconds. Defaults to 30
#	if not specified.  See the tcp(7) man page for details.
#EXAMPLE:
## FreeBSD
#accept_filter httpready
## Linux
#accept_filter data
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_ip_max_connections
#	Set an absolute limit on the number of connections a single
#	client IP can use. Any more than this and Squid will begin to drop
#	new connections from the client until it closes some links.
#
#	Note that this is a global limit. It affects all HTTP, HTCP, Gopher and FTP
#	connections from the client. For finer control use the ACL access controls.
#
#	Requires client_db to be enabled (the default).
#
#	WARNING: This may noticably slow down traffic received via external proxies
#	or NAT devices and cause them to rebound error messages back to their clients.
#Default:
# client_ip_max_connections -1

#  TAG: tcp_recv_bufsize	(bytes)
#	Size of receive buffer to set for TCP sockets.  Probably just
#	as easy to change your kernel's default.  Set to zero to use
#	the default buffer size.
#Default:
# tcp_recv_bufsize 0 bytes

# ICAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icap_enable	on|off
#	If you want to enable the ICAP module support, set this to on.
#Default:
# icap_enable off

#  TAG: icap_connect_timeout
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for the TCP connect to
#	the requested ICAP server to complete before giving up and either
#	terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the failure.
#
#	The default for optional services is peer_connect_timeout.
#	The default for essential services is connect_timeout.
#	If this option is explicitly set, its value applies to all services.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_io_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for an I/O activity on
#	an established, active ICAP connection before giving up and
#	either terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the
#	failure.
#
#	The default is read_timeout.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_service_failure_limit
#	The limit specifies the number of failures that Squid tolerates
#	when establishing a new TCP connection with an ICAP service. If
#	the number of failures exceeds the limit, the ICAP service is
#	not used for new ICAP requests until it is time to refresh its
#	OPTIONS. The per-service failure counter is reset to zero each
#	time Squid fetches new service OPTIONS.
#
#	A negative value disables the limit. Without the limit, an ICAP
#	service will not be considered down due to connectivity failures
#	between ICAP OPTIONS requests.
#Default:
# icap_service_failure_limit 10

#  TAG: icap_service_revival_delay
#	The delay specifies the number of seconds to wait after an ICAP
#	OPTIONS request failure before requesting the options again. The
#	failed ICAP service is considered "down" until fresh OPTIONS are
#	fetched.
#
#	The actual delay cannot be smaller than the hardcoded minimum
#	delay of 30 seconds.
#Default:
# icap_service_revival_delay 180

#  TAG: icap_preview_enable	on|off
#	The ICAP Preview feature allows the ICAP server to handle the
#	HTTP message by looking only at the beginning of the message body
#	or even without receiving the body at all. In some environments, 
#	previews greatly speedup ICAP processing.
#
#	During an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, the server may tell	Squid what
#	HTTP messages should be previewed and how big the preview should be.
#	Squid will not use Preview if the server did not request one.
#
#	To disable ICAP Preview for all ICAP services, regardless of
#	individual ICAP server OPTIONS responses, set this option to "off".
#Example:
#icap_preview_enable off
#Default:
# icap_preview_enable on

#  TAG: icap_preview_size
#	The default size of preview data to be sent to the ICAP server.
#	-1 means no preview. This value might be overwritten on a per server
#	basis by OPTIONS requests.
#Default:
# icap_preview_size -1

#  TAG: icap_default_options_ttl
#	The default TTL value for ICAP OPTIONS responses that don't have
#	an Options-TTL header.
#Default:
# icap_default_options_ttl 60

#  TAG: icap_persistent_connections	on|off
#	Whether or not Squid should use persistent connections to
#	an ICAP server.
#Default:
# icap_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: icap_send_client_ip	on|off
#	If enabled, Squid shares HTTP client IP information with adaptation
#	services. For ICAP, Squid adds the X-Client-IP header to ICAP requests.
#	For eCAP, Squid sets the libecap::metaClientIp transaction option.
#
#	See also: adaptation_uses_indirect_client
#Default:
# icap_send_client_ip off

#  TAG: icap_send_client_username	on|off
#	This sends authenticated HTTP client username (if available) to
#	the ICAP service. The username value is encoded based on the
#	icap_client_username_encode option and is sent using the header
#	specified by the icap_client_username_header option.
#Default:
# icap_send_client_username off

#  TAG: icap_client_username_header
#	ICAP request header name to use for send_client_username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_header X-Client-Username

#  TAG: icap_client_username_encode	on|off
#	Whether to base64 encode the authenticated client username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_encode off

#  TAG: icap_service
#	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:
#
#	icap_service service_name vectoring_point [options] service_url
#
#	service_name: ID
#		an opaque identifier which must be unique in squid.conf
#
#	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#
#	service_url: icap://servername:port/servicepath
#		ICAP server and service location.
#
#	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
#	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
#	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
#	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
#	service_names differ.
#
#
#	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
#	the following name=value options:
#
#	bypass=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
#		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
#		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
#		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
#		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
#		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
#		returned to the HTTP client.
#
#		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.
#
#	routing=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
#		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
#		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
#		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
#		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
#		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf and
#		should have the same method and vectoring point as the current
#		ICAP transaction.  Services violating these rules are ignored.
#		An empty X-Next-Services value results in an empty plan which
#		ends the current adaptation. 
#
#		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
#		response header is ignored.
#
#	ipv6=on|off
#		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
#		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
#		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.
#
#	Older icap_service format without optional named parameters is
#	deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.

#Example:
#icap_service svcBlocker reqmod_precache bypass=0 icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod

#Default:

#  TAG: icap_class
#	This deprecated option was documented to define an ICAP service
#	chain, even though it actually defined a set of similar, redundant
#	services, and the chains were not supported. 
#
#	To define a set of redundant services, please use the
#	adaptation_service_set directive. For service chains, use
#	adaptation_service_chain.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_access
#	This option is deprecated. Please use adaptation_access, which
#	has the same ICAP functionality, but comes with better
#	documentation, and eCAP support.
#Default:
# none

# eCAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ecap_enable	on|off
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-ecap option
#
#	Controls whether eCAP support is enabled.
#Default:
# ecap_enable off

#  TAG: ecap_service
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-ecap option
#
#	Defines a single eCAP service
#
#	ecap_service servicename vectoring_point bypass service_url
#
#	vectoring_point = reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		eCAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#	bypass = 1|0
#		If set to 1, the eCAP service is treated as optional. If the
#		service cannot be reached or malfunctions, Squid will try to
#		ignore any errors and process the message as if the service
#		was not enabled. No all eCAP errors can be bypassed.
#		If set to 0, the eCAP service is treated as essential and all
#		eCAP errors will result in an error page returned to the
#		HTTP client.
#	service_url = ecap://vendor/service_name?custom&cgi=style&parameters=optional
#
#Example:
#ecap_service service_1 reqmod_precache 0 ecap://filters-R-us/leakDetector?on_error=block
#ecap_service service_2 respmod_precache 1 icap://filters-R-us/virusFilter?config=/etc/vf.cfg
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: loadable_modules
#	Instructs Squid to load the specified dynamic module(s) or activate
#	preloaded module(s).
#Example:
#loadable_modules /usr/lib/MinimalAdapter.so
#Default:
# none

# MESSAGE ADAPTATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: adaptation_service_set
#
#	Configures an ordered set of similar, redundant services. This is
#	useful when hot standby or backup adaptation servers are available.
#
#	    adaptation_service_set set_name service_name1 service_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the set declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the set is used first. The next
#	applicable service is tried if and only if the transaction with the
#	previous service fails and the message waiting to be adapted is still
#	intact.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the set. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	The services in a set must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	If all services in a set are optional then adaptation failures are
#	bypassable. If all services in the set are essential, then a
#	transaction failure with one service may still be retried using
#	another service from the set, but when all services fail, the master
#	transaction fails as well.
#
#	A set may contain a mix of optional and essential services, but that
#	is likely to lead to surprising results because broken services become
#	ignored (see above), making previously bypassable failures fatal.
#	Technically, it is the bypassability of the last failed service that
#	matters.
#
#	See also: adaptation_access adaptation_service_chain
#
#Example:
#adaptation_service_set svcBlocker urlFilterPrimary urlFilterBackup
#adaptation service_set svcLogger loggerLocal loggerRemote
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_service_chain
#
#	Configures a list of complementary services that will be applied
#	one-by-one, forming an adaptation chain or pipeline. This is useful
#	when Squid must perform different adaptations on the same message.
#
#	    adaptation_service_chain chain_name service_name1 svc_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the chain declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the chain is used first. The next
#	applicable service is applied to the successful adaptation results of
#	the previous service in the chain.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the chain. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	Request satisfaction terminates the adaptation chain because Squid
#	does not currently allow declaration of RESPMOD services at the
#	"reqmod_precache" vectoring point (see icap_service or ecap_service).
#
#	The services in a chain must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	A chain may contain a mix of optional and essential services. If an
#	essential adaptation fails (or the failure cannot be bypassed for
#	other reasons), the master transaction fails. Otherwise, the failure
#	is bypassed as if the failed adaptation service was not in the chain.

#adaptation_service_chain svcRequest requestLogger urlFilter leakDetector
